# Check-Dominos-Order
Automatically grab the XML from Domino's order tracker and parse it to get status updates on your pizza

My kids love Dominos, so we order from there fairly often.

I usually order it for carry-out because we're only a few blocks away from the store.

I wanted to track the progress of my order, then kick off an IFTTT event to trigger my Google Home to announce when it's time
to go pick up my pizza.
